### Hi, I'm Edward â˜•

I'm a fullstack engineer, with a focus on frontend work.

I run [Black Mammoth](https://blackmammoth.co/), where I work with B2B marketing teams to help them get the most out of their websites.
I also run a product studio @ <a href='https://www.dock90.io'>dock90</a> focused on building simple products.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Swift.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about running a startup studio, validating ideas, or anything really - I enjoy a good conversation.
